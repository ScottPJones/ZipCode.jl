# TODO

### Docs/Integrity

* Further inline documentation of functions, API

* Readthedocs

* Write tests for distance formulas

### Enhancements & Feature Rounding

* Implement algorithms for more accurate distance calculations

* Create way for users to access expected error rate of distance calcs

* Build out convenience functions for quicker/easier access of subsets and
  relevant vector operations

* Quicker way to run distance calcs on subsets. Maybe something like:

  `distance(zipcodeA, zipcodeB)`


* Ability to return closest match(es) given lat/long coordinates

* Ability to query via distance tolerance

### Long Term

* Further build out of the current data set: detailed edges of counties, states, etc;
  additional geographic features

* Use as a starting point for a wider-scoped geodata package (more than just U.S.)

* Possibly integrate with other Julia geo-related orgs/packages as needed
